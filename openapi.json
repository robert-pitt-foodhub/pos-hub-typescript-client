{"openapi":"3.0.1","info":{"title":"POS Hub API","version":"1.8.9.5","description":"## Introduction\n\nWelcome to the POS Hub API documentation. This guide is designed to provide you with all the necessary information to seamlessly integrate your application with the POS Hub platform. Whether you're integrating a point-of-sale system, a reporting tool, an order management system, or any other application that interacts with the POS Hub API, this documentation will serve as your comprehensive resource.\n\nWithin this documentation, you will find detailed explanations of the API standards, authentication processes, common integration patterns, and pagination techniques employed by the POS Hub API. We will guide you through the steps of authenticating your application, making authenticated requests, and managing token expiration and refresh processes.\n\nBy following this documentation, you will be able to harness the full potential of the POS Hub API to optimize your business operations, access valuable data, and deliver a seamless experience to your users.\n\nLet’s get started!\n\n## API\n\nThe API section provides a thorough overview of the standards adhered to by the POS Hub API. These standards are in place to ensure consistency and compatibility across all endpoints.\n\n### API Features\n\n- Detailed documentation is generated directly from our implementation code, ensuring accuracy and up-to-date information.\n- OAuth2 standards are used for authenticating users and applications, as well as performing application onboarding via the authorization flow.\n- Resource-oriented endpoints provide GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE functionality across various entities.\n- All HTTP communication is conducted exclusively over SSL, both internally between systems and externally with partners.\n- Requests and responses are strictly formatted using application/json, including all error responses.\n- Our endpoints support cursor-based pagination, enabling efficient data retrieval within a resource.\n- We adhere to relevant ISO standards for common values, including ISO 8601 for dates/times, ISO 4217 for currency codes, and ISO 639-1 for language codes and E.164 to represent global phone numbers.\n\n### API Contracts\n\nIt is important to understand that the POS Hub API defines schemas for both request, response and webhook payloads. These schemas serve as a contract between POS Hub and API consumers. Compliance with these schemas is crucial, as all fields, data types, required flags, enumerations, and other specifications are validated against this documentation. Careful adherence to this documentation is essential for successful integration with our API.\n\nOur schemas define the following information:\n\n- Property Names: (e.g., orderId, status)\n- Property Types: (e.g., string, number, boolean, or another schema)\n- Allowed Values: Specified by enumeration tags\n- String Length and Numeric Size: Minimum and maximum values\n- Value Formatting: Such as uuid, uri, or date-time\n- Field Requirements: Required or optional fields\n\n### Authentication\n\nThere are multiple methods of authentication depending on what your trying to, typically applications will be using the `client_credentials` flow, however we have outlined the different types below.\n\n#### Password Grant\n\nthe `password` grant type is used if you as the account owner wishes to authenticate to gain user level access, this requires a username and password to autheneticate, this is useful for resellers who wish to build in house custom tooling, allowing them to create a user within the reseller and authenticate to perform api calls as that user.\n\nNote: the `password` grant requires POS Hub team to authorize this grant for your application, this is typically only done for enterprise customers, if you need this grant please reach out to one of our team.\n\n#### Client Credentials Grant\n\nthe `client_credentials` grant os the grant used when an application wishes to get an an application level access token, this is by applications that need to perform authenticated requests on a location, such as inject an order, update a catalog or pull a menu.\n\nApplication credentials allows the application acces to all the locations that it has been authorized for, and the access is further limited to the scopes that the application is allowed and/or requested within the token request.\n\nExample Request\n\n```shell\ncurl -X POST -H \"Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" -d \"grant_type=client_credentials&client_id=<CLIENT_ID>&client_secret=<CLIENT_SECRET>\" \"{path}/oauth2/token\"\n```\n\nExample Response\n\n```json\n{ \"access_token\": \"[access-token]\", \"token_type\": \"Bearer\", \"expires_in\": 3600 }\n```\n\n#### Authorization Code Grant\n\nThe `authorization_code` grant is used when an application wishes to initiate the onboarding to a location, the application will prepare an\n`/authorize` url which will inlcude the client id, client secret, redirect uri and required scopes, the application should redirect the user to the authoization url, once the user has been redirect to the url, they will be promted to authenticate and authorize your acccess to a selected location of their choosing.\n\nOnce the user has authorzed the request, they will be redirected back to the redirect uri with an intermediate token called the `code`, this code contains the users intent to authorize your application, taking this `code` property you can make a follow up call to the token endpoint with this intermediate code\nto complete the onboarding steps.\n\nOnce the authorization flow us complete, the aplication credentials that are generated with the `client_credentials` flow will now have permission for this new store.\n\n### Client Registration\n\nBefore your application can authenticate and access the POS Hub API, you must first create an application within your [POS Hub Developer's](https://tryposhub.com) area. Once your application is created, you will be issued a unique client ID and client secret, which are essential credentials for establishing a secure connection with the API. These credentials ensure that only authorized applications can interact with the POS Hub API, maintaining the integrity and privacy of your data.\n\n### API Security Defintions\n\n<SecurityDefinitions />\n\n### Authenticating Requests\n\nTo securely access the POS Hub API, you need to include a valid access token in the Authorization header of your API requests. This access token allows your application to interact with API resources and perform operations on behalf of the user.\n\nTo include the access token in your requests, use the Bearer token type in the Authorization header:\n\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer [access-token]\n```\n\nHere's an example of an authenticated request to retrieve a list of orders for an onboarded application:\n\n```\ncurl -X GET https://api.trypos hub.com/accounts/{accountId}/locations/{locationId}/order/{orderId} \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer [access-token]\"\n```\n\n**Note: Replace [access-token] with the actual access token you received in the token response.**\n\n### Refresh Token Grant Flow\n\nTo ensure secure and uninterrupted access to the POS Hub API, it's important to understand and utilize the refresh token grant flow. This flow allows you to obtain new access tokens without the need to provide client credentials again.\n\nWhen you obtain an access token through the client credentials grant flow, it has a limited lifespan for security reasons. The duration of the token's validity is typically set to 1 hour, as indicated by the \"expires_in\" field in the response.\n\nTo refresh an expiring access token, your application should make a token refresh request to the `/oauth2/token` endpoint using the refresh token grant type. This request will provide you with a new access token and a new refresh token.\n\nOnce you receive the new tokens, replace the old access token and refresh token in your authenticated requests with the new ones. This ensures seamless access to the POS Hub API without interruption.\n\nBy proactively managing token expiration and utilizing the refresh token grant flow, you can maintain secure and continuous access to authorized resources in your integrations with the POS Hub API.\n\n## Common Patterns\n\nOur API Is designed to have common and consistent patterns across all the endpoints, patterns such as pagination, filtering, and response envolopes.\n\n### Response\n\nThere are two types of responses this API produces:\n\n1. Object Response\n   An object response is the structure that is returned when you working with a single item, such as an GET, POST, PUT or patch on an endpoint that ends with an id parameter, such as `/v1/accounts/{accountId}`, these response will always return a JSON Object with a single data field, the value of the data field is the single object you are reading or mutating.\n\n2. List Response\n   A list response is the structure that is returned when your working with list of items, such as a `GET` request on an api endpoint that returns a list of objects, such as `/v1/accounts` or `/v1/accounts/{accountId}/locations`.\n\nThe fields in the response are:\n\n| property    | description                                                                                                                      |\n| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| nextPageKey | A `string` that contains a unique pagination key, this can be passed back to the api on subsequent events to fetch the next page |\n| hasNextPage | A `boolean` flag that indicates if there is another page of data available based on your current query request                   |\n| data        | A `Array<Entity>` list that has the list of entities within the current page of data                                             |\n\n### Pagination\n\nPOS Hub employs \"Cursor-Based Pagination\" instead of the traditional \"Offset-Based Pagination\" for several key reasons:\n\n1. **Efficiency:** Cursor-based pagination offers faster and more efficient data retrieval, particularly with large datasets. Unlike offset-based pagination, which skips a fixed number of records, cursor-based pagination retrieves the next set of records using a unique identifier (cursor). This approach avoids the overhead of scanning through and skipping records, leading to quicker response times.\n\n2. **Stability:** Cursor-based pagination is more reliable with frequently changing data. In offset-based pagination, adding or removing records between requests can lead to inconsistent results. Cursor-based pagination uses unique cursors, ensuring data remains consistent and accurate even if changes occur.\n\n3. **Predictability:** Cursor-based pagination provides predictable results. When requesting the next page of data using a cursor, you will receive the same records as long as the dataset remains unchanged. This predictability is essential for maintaining data integrity and consistency in your applications.\n\n### Example Flow of Cursor-Based Pagination\n\n1. **Initial Request:** Specify the number of records per page and any filters or sorting criteria in your initial API request. The API will respond with the first page of results and provide a cursor indicating where the next page begins.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET -H \"Authorization: Bearer [access-token]\" \"{path}/orders?limit=10\"\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{ \"data\": [...], \"hasNextPage\": true, \"nextPageKey\": \"[next-page-token]\" }\n```\n\n2. **Subsequent Requests:** To retrieve the next page of results, use the `nextPageKey` value from the previous response in your next request.\n\n```bash\ncurl -X GET -H \"Authorization: Bearer [access-token]\" \"{path}/orders?limit=10&nextPageKey=[next-page-token]\"\n```\n\n**Response:**\n\n```json\n{ \"data\": [...], \"hasNextPage\": true, \"nextPageKey\": \"[next-page-token]\" }\n```\n\n3. **Repeat:** Continue retrieving subsequent pages by including the `nextPageKey` in your requests until no more pages are available (i.e., `hasNextPage` is false or `nextPageKey` is not present).\n","termsOfService":"https://tryposhub.com/terms","license":{"name":"POS Hub","url":"https://tryposhub.com"},"contact":{"name":"POS Hub Support","email":"support@tryposhub.com","url":"https://tryposhub.com"},"x-tagGroups":[{"name":"User","tags":["Authentication API","Users API","Applications API"]},{"name":"Accounts","tags":["Accounts API","Locations API"]},{"name":"Locations","tags":["Orders API","Catalogs API","Menus API","Deliveries API"]}]},"servers":[{"url":"https://api.tryposhub.com"}],"paths":{"/v1/resellers/{resellerId}/locations":{"get":{"parameters":[{"name":"nextPageKey","in":"query","schema":{"type":"string"}},{"name":"query","in":"query","schema":{"type":"string"}},{"name":"limit","in":"query","schema":{"type":"string"},"description":"*Pagination:* The number of items to return per page (max 50)"},{"name":"resellerId","in":"path","required":true,"schema":{"type":"string"}}],"responses":{"200":{"description":"200 response","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ListLocationsResponse"}}}},"401":{"description":"Unauthorized","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}}},"403":{"description":"Forbidden","content":{"application/json":{"schema":{"$ref":"#/components/schemas/ErrorResponse"}}}}},"security":[{"TokenAuthorizer":["resellers.read"]}],"tags":["Reseller Management"],"summary":"List Locations","description":"This endpoint lists all locations that are associated with a specific reseller identified by the resellerId parameter.
